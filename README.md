This section will simply show examples of how to solve tickets along with the process of completing tickets. Lets say a ticket is made from another department and your QA Manager has sorted out the tickets from SLA priority and assignment. But for this example lets say you have to assign tickets and they're not sorted by SLA. Once you login as an agent, you'll see a list of tickets. Once you open a ticket, you can set the priority based on how impactful it is to your businesses or operations. For example if it's businees impactful like your online banking is down. You will want to set a higher priority for that to be fixed. While something like a simple question you should be set lower on the priority list. While adjusting the setting for the ticket you can send ticket to different departments and assign a specific person to a ticket if you need to. You can see a ticket thread below the ticket to see all the changes made on a ticket from a specific agent. You can even add notes at the bottom of a ticket if you need to.

Lets say as an agent you get a ticket about a piece of software from another department just recently updated but ended up not working after the update. For a situation like this it depends on how your organizations SLAs are assigned but let's say it's High on the priority list and needs to be fixed within 4 hrs, Sev-B. Once you recieve the information on the software needing to be fixed. You start troubleshooting, in this case the software stopped working do to a software update. Since you have about 4 hrs to find and issue and fix it. You may want to test at the source along with gathering information online afterwards. You install the previous version of the software that the department was using. Once installed you update your version to the latest software update and the software stopped working just like ticket described. You roll back the software to the previous version and it works again. At this point you may not know exactly what part of the software update has stopped this program from working in the latest newest version. But you do know that the previous version does work. Since time is limited and that department wants to get back to working order again. You send a reply to the ticket user to have them roll back there software update as the previous version is working without issues. In the mean time you will do some research online to see what maybe impeding the software from working in the latest version. After which you can send and resolve the ticket if the ticket has been resolved. In many cases the issue may be a simple bug has prevented a piece of software from working and simply waiting for a patch to come out will resolve the issue and or error.
