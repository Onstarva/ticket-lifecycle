This section will simply show examples of how to solve tickets along with the process of completing tickets. Lets say a ticket is made from another department and your QA Manager has sorted out the tickets from SLA priority and assignment. But for this example lets say you have to assign tickets and they're not sorted by SLA. Once you login as an agent, you'll see a list of tickets. Once you open a ticket, you can set the priority based on how impactful it is to your businesses or operations. For example if it's businees impactful like your online banking is down. You will want to set a higher priority for that to be fixed. While something like a simple question you should be set lower on the priority list. While adjusting the setting for the ticket you can send ticket to different departments and assign a specific person to a ticket if you need to. You can see a ticket thread below the ticket to see all the changes made on a ticket from a specific agent. You can even add notes at the bottom of a ticket if you need to.

Lets say as an agent you get a ticket about a piece of software from another department just recently updated but ended up not working after the update. For a situation like this it depends on how your organizations SLAs are assigned but let's say it's High on the priority list and needs to be fixed within 4 hrs, Sev-B. Once you received the information on the software used. You start troubleshooting, in this case the software stopped working after a software update. Since you have about 4 hrs to find and resolve the issue. You may want to test the problem at the source along with gathering information online afterwards. You install the previous version of the software that the said department was using. Once installed you update your version of the software and find the software stopped working just as described in the ticket. So you roll back the software to the previous version once had installed and it starts working again. At this point you may not know exactly what part of the software update has stopped the program from running in the latest version. But you do know that the previous version does work. Since time is limited and that said department wants to get back to operating again. You send a reply to the ticket user to have them roll back there software update to the previous version to resolve there issues. You also let them know that in the mean time you'll be doing some research online to see what maybe impeding the software from working properly after the update. After which you can mark ticket as resolved, reply and do some research online to find what maybe occuring. In many cases it maybe a simple bug has prevented that software from working properly and a simple patch hasn't rolled out yet to resolve it. So in time that department can update there software to the latest version.
